    <h1>Marilynne Tepper</h1>
    <p> A little about me, I was born in South Carolina but call Florida my home! I'm a wife and a mom. I have a dog and two cats and currently live in Georgia while my husband is serving in the US Navy. In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching reality tv, playing video games and baking sourdough bread! I enjoy cooking for my family and have recently gained an interest in gardening. My dream would be to live on a homestead with bees, goats, chickens and a beautiful garden full of fruits, vegetables and flowers.

    <ul>
        <li> I graduated from Seminole State College in Orlando, FL with an Associates of Arts degree.</li>
        <li> I graduated from Paul Mitchell Hair School of Charleston and have my Master Cosmetologist certificate. </li>
        <li> I'm currently doing the most rewarding job in the world: being a stay-at-home mom to my 2 year old. We decided this is the most important thing while my husband is active duty.</li>
        <li> I decided to pursue an interest that can afford me the ability to stay home with my daughter but also make me feel fulfilled in a career. This is how I started software development. </li>
    </ul>
